				<p>Shirley Lin is a student at American University studying International Services with a
				minor in International Business. She has immigrant parents from China who
				came to the United States to pursue master's degrees. Given her family background, Shirley was inspired to join this non-profit because of its goals to
				help marginalized citizens take control of finances. She wants to give back by supporting individuals in the community who are driven by the American dream, and helping individuals who are stuck in a cycle of poverty. Shirley hopes to one day see the Dollar Scholars project expand internationally, so all marginalized communities have a voice of advocacy for their
				financial education regardless of where they live. Outside of the Dollar Scholars project, Shirley enjoys writing articles advocating for human
				rights for the Human Rights Research Center, and reading about international relations, law, and
				business. A fun fact about her is that she lets Icelandic horses write her emails when she's out of
				the office. No not kidding, <a href="https://www.visiticeland.com/outhorse-your-email">Check it out!</a>
